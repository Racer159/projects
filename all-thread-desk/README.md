# All-thread Desk

Below are instructions for creating a desk from plywood that is suspended by all-thread rods.  The design goals of this desk were as follows:

1. **Customizable** - the desk should be customizable to fit different needs
2. **Modular** - the desk should be modular to support upgrading over time
3. **Flat-packable** - the desk should be able to break down into a small footprint for moving
4. **Large** - the desk should be able to scale up to support a lot of equipment on top
